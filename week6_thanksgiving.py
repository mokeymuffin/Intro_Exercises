 mega challenges
write program that validates that a user has input a valid email address, and doesn't let a person continue until a valid email address is entered
for example :" melissa@hackbrightacademy.com" is valid and "melissa@hackbrightacademy" or" @hackbrightacademy.com
" is not valid.

If you want to add complexity to the email validator, have your code return hints to user on what's wrong with their email.

Here are some helper variables:

top_level_domain = ['mil', 'gov', 'edu', 'int', 'net', 'org', 'com']
email_fail_msg = "this is not a valid email. Please try again. "
email_pass = "thank you for entering a valid email address!"

Some hints:
you can try exploring while-loops, and importing the regex (regular expressions) module in python
