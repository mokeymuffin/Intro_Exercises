Here are a couple Practice Problems for you to work on after your class exercises.  this is a primarily a thinking exercise. Write down the steps or methods you think it would take the solve the problem. 


For each problem, create a function that meets the objective.

1.     takes an integer value and returns True if k is even, and  False otherwise.  However, your function cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators 

2.     takes two integer values and returns True if n  is a multiple of m ,that is, n=mi for some integer I and False otherwise 

3.     takes a sequence  of one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest numbers, in the form of a tuple of length two.  Do not use the built-in functions min or max in implementing your solution

4.     Write a function that takes a positive integer n and returns the sum of the squares of all the positive integers smaller than n

Stretch Goal:
If you want to test your "recipe" of problem solving steps, feel free to use any language you're currently comfortable with (blockly, scratch, snap!, python, javascript, ruby etc)
